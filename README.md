# 🎶 Guitar Hero Prototype 

This project is a Guitar Hero replica of the song "Happy Birthday," created as a final project for my **Engineering/Computer Science Principles** and **Linear Algebra courses.** The game's core logic is built upon concepts from projective geometry, using matrix transformations to translate a note's position from the game's coordinate system to the player's perspective, allowing for accurate gameplay and scoring. My informal research on this topic can be found at https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:US:98b5077e-46ef-4900-ab4b-6eb02728ac18.
